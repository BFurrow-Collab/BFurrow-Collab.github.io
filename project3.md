## Project description

[[???]]

## How to compile and run the program

Download the project from the GitHub repository as a zip file.
In whichever way you choose, download and install the latest JDK (Java Development Kit) for your system and/or IDE to use the program.<br/>
(*Note: This project was originally programmed in NetBeans IDE. Therefore, not all the files present in the repository are necessary. However, those additional files were kept in case one would wish for it in its original form.*) <br/>
Unzip the project folder to a directory of your choice.
Open a terminal of your preference that can use Java and start running the program.

## UI Design

[[???]]

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

## 3. Additional Considerations

If I could have added anything to this project, it would be some sort of visuals. As the game is, it is entirely text-based. While the game is functional, it would be far more fun with that extra visual element. However, our time was limited and nobody in the group specialized in that sort of thing, so we didn't expand beyond our scope.
