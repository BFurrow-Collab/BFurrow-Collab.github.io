## Project description

This project ... (describe the Battleship game, describe what is being worked on specifically)

This project consists of two parts. The first part is a simple HTML parser that can determine if the HTML tags in a given page is balanced or not. A page is considered balanced if each html tag has a beginning and ending tag at the same level of depth. The parser does so by iterating through the file, identifying tags, and then pushing/popping with a stack to determine if they are on the same level. The second part makes an HTML web crawler that, by visiting linked pages, determines the number of unique pages that can be visited from a certain page (excluding unvisitable pages such as those that don't exist). The web crawler does so using recursion to dive down into identified links, counting those that are unique and visitable. There are a number of test cases written as well to stretch the capabilities of the parser/crawler to its extremes.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
