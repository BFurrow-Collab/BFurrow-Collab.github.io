## How to compile and run the program

Download the project from the GitHub repository as a zip file.
Unzip the project folder to a directory of your choice.
Using WSL Ubuntu, open the WSL Ubuntu terminal.
Navigate to the directory where you extracted the program files (using commands "ls" and "cd").
Type "make" in the terminal as a final setup before running the program.
Use either make commands or manually select pages to operate the program.
```cpp
make /*makefile command*/
// OR
./html-test /*file name/relative location*/
```
Further operation of the program is discussed in the UI design.

## UI Design

This program can be operated within WSL Ubuntu (see Fig 1). In the project folder, the user can type "make" to initialize the program, then proceed in one of two ways. The user can continue using make commands as it is displayed in the makefile (see Fig 2 and 3), or they can manually select pages by saying "./[[???]] (program to parse/crawl)" (see Fig 4). The results will then print out in the WSL Ubuntu terminal as seen in the two previous figures.
