## Project description

This project was made as an assignment where the class would follow along a set of instructions. Starting with ISO files from a flashdrive to use with a virtual machine, the assignment would teach and show how to setup and apply Active Directory, Organizational Units, and Group/User Policies. This would demonstrate one of the primary ways that domain admins and network engineers mitigate potential risk with hardware security, network security, and controlling user access.

## How to run the program

All of the details of proceeding through this program are in the following document: <br/>

## UI Design

You can find every step and topic of the user interaction within the two previous links - the documented steps and the walkthrough video. 

In the shorthand, though, ... (list some of the tasks and what it does that can be screenshots)

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
